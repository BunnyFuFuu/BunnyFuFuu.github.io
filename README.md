## Welcome to my website!
This is a website created using React, and is meant to showcase myself both as a person and shine a little more light on any professional or project experience I may have gained as a software developer. I partially automated the project updates to work with Github's API so I don't always need to return here to manually make a card and update the site. I basically just get all the public repositories from my account and if they're enabled to be shown on this site (which I implement in each repository by a file containing the data necessary to create the card) then a card will be automatically generated on my Projects tab!
